# Waveanoid: A Kinect for Windows Game #

An open source C# single player game which makes use of the Windows Kinect Platform and SDK v1.8.

The game represents the famous game from 80s known as Arkanoid.

The game uses gestures, speech recognition and the tracking of joints for interaction. After the player shouts "Start", the balls launches and they have to physically change the position of their left or right hand to move the bat and position it correctly so that it collides with the ball upon its descent.

The user has to force the ball to collide with all of the blocks in order to win the game.

The end product will have the following features:-
  * Completely random and dynamic blocks which form depending on difficulty settings
  * User interaction through the use of voice and gestures by using the Kinect camera
  * Several different game levels and a final level to finish it
  * Tracking and monitoring of high scores and perhaps an online database of these scores
  * Various settings to make the game more suited for the user and their environment, including "seated mode" and possibility to override voice commands
  * Powerups, hints, and even cheat codes

### The first alpha version of this game is still in development and the source is not yet open. Please check back for the first version of the source code. ###
